# Data_eng_project1_Pragya
Hello, this is a repo for Project 1 of IDS 706: Data Engineering. Here, I am using Kaggle Dataset on books scraped via the Goodreads API (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)


## Goals of the project:
1. Build a repo in Github
2. Configure “scaffold”: Makefile,requirementsfile, app file (example: streamlit, cli, fastapi), test file
3. Test with Github Actions
4. To build a very simple microservice system that talks to a Big Data Script using Dask. 
5. Create a webservice using FastAPI 
6. Testing in demo (link)
